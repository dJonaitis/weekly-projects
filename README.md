# weekly-projects
Once a week coding projects. Started on Monday, the 26th of February, 2024.

## Week 1 - (Feb. 26 - Mar. 3) : Raycasting
A small applet to simulate a light source casting rays all around it. Utilises HTML5 canvas and pure JS. 

## Week 2 - (Mar. 4 - Mar. 10) : Lunar Lander
A small lunar lander game inspired by [this one](http://moonlander.seb.ly/). Utilises HTML5 canvas and pure JS. 

## Week 3 - (Mar. 11 - Mar. 17) : CRT-Surveillance
A website (and Jupyter notebook) to visualise arms transfers. The website visualises all arms transfers from the US, the Jupyter notebook also uses Lithuania as an example for weapons imports. Made using the [SIPRI arms transfers](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers) dataset. Utilises JavaScript and d3.js for mapping, CSS, as well as Python and some libraries (seaborn, pandas, geopy, pycountry). **To be revisited.**
